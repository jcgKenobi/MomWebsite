## 🔍 Key Differences Demonstrated

### Analysis Tool (Code Execution)
✅ **Perfect for:**
- Data analysis and calculations
- Testing code logic
- Processing uploaded files
- Quick prototyping
- Mathematical operations

❌ **Limitations:**
- Code runs temporarily (nothing saved)
- JavaScript only
- Can't create permanent files
- Limited to analysis/calculation tasks

### File Creation
✅ **Perfect for:**
- Building actual applications
- Creating permanent, reusable files
- Any programming language
- Complete project development
- Files you can open in other programs

❌ **Considerations:**
- Files are saved permanently
- Need to manage file organization
- Requires proper file paths

## 🎯 When to Use Each

| Task | Use Analysis Tool | Use File Creation |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Calculate compound interest | ✅ | ❌ |
| Process CSV data | ✅ | ❌ |
| Build a website | ❌ | ✅ |
| Create reusable scripts | ❌ | ✅ |
| Test JavaScript logic | ✅ | ❌ |
| Save work for later | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Use These Demo Files

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Open `analytics-dashboard.html` in your browser to see the interactive dashboard
2. **Website Utils**: Include `website-utils.js` in your HTML projects: `<script src="website-utils.js"></script>`
3. **Configuration**: Load `config.json` in your applications to access centralized settings

## 💡 Next Steps

You can now:
- Modify any of these files using the file editing tools
- Create new files for your specific project needs
- Use the analysis tool for data processing and calculations
- Combine both approaches for complete development workflows
